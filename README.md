# Libft
- Personal code library
- The only library we're allowed to use at Hive (42)
- Conforms to the school's standard code-style, aka "The Norm"
  - The official Norm PDF (English) is included in this repo.

## Why did you do X like that? That's weird / awkward.
Mood, probably. I'm very curious and experimentative when it comes to syntax and I get a kick out of doing things in clever ways. I do this *fully aware* that it's probably not the smartest thing to do, in case I need to come back to it. Unfortunately our school's coding style is very strict (in much the wrong ways) and sometimes I will butt heads with it.

In general, I value clear naming conventions *(no exceptions)* and code above all else when I'm writing code for someone else, such as my tutorials.
